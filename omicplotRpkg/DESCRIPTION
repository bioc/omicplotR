Description: A Shiny app for visual exploration of omic datasets as
    compositions, and differential abundance analysis using ALDEx2. Useful for
    exploring RNA-seq, meta-RNA-seq, 16s rRNA gene sequencing and more with
    visualizations such as principal component analysis biplot (coloured using
    metadata for visualizing each variable), association plots (igraph),
    dendrograms and stacked bar plots, and effect plots (ALDEx2). Input is a
    table of counts and metadata file (if metadata exists), with options to
    filter data by count or by metadata to remove low counts, or to visualize
    select samples according to selected metadata. The Shiny app's graphical
    user interface facilitates visual exploration for new and experienced users
    of R alike.
